## CI/CD

This project includes a **Jenkinsfile** that defines a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Install** — Runs `npm install` to restore dependencies
2. **Build** — Runs `npm run build` to produce a production bundle

On success, built JavaScript artifacts are archived with fingerprinting for traceability.
